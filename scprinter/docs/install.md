Start to use
============

If you want to run it on your machine, workstation, talk to Ruochi or Yan.

For beta testing, you can use it on fasrc following this procedure:

1. Log in to fasrc
2. Run this command in shell
```
echo "/n/holylfs05/LABS/buenrostro_lab/Lab/scprinter_env" >> ~/.conda/environments.txt
```

After that, `scprinter_env` should appear in your jupyter-lab ipykernel list.

3. Start jupyter-lab in your preferred way. One example would be using interactive apps of fasrc. Connect to fasrc, 
and then go to `https://vdi.rc.fas.harvard.edu`
