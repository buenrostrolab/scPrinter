scprinter: A Python package for single-cell multi-scale footprinting
=====================================================================

scPrinter is the python implementation of PRINT.

Main advantages:
 - Much faster (40-60x faster)
 - More flexible (generate footprints for any region / cell groupings)
 - More portable (No need to share fragments, share the printer object (10x smaller))
 - Real time synced visualization of footprinting results.
 - Generalizable to low-cov bulk ATAC & scATAC-seq

Coming functions:
 - Differential testing
