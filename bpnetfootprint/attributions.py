    """A function for aggregating contributions into hypothetical attributions.

    When handling categorical data, like one-hot encodings, the attributions
    returned by a method like DeepLIFT/SHAP may need to be modified slightly.
    Specifically, one needs to account for each nucleotide change actually
    being the addition of one category AND the subtraction of another category.
    Basically, once you've calculated the multipliers, you need to subtract
    out the contribution of the nucleotide actually present and then add in
    the contribution of the nucleotide you are becomming.

    These values are then averaged over all references.


    Parameters
    ----------
    multipliers: torch.tensor, shape=(n_baselines, 4, length)
        The multipliers determined by DeepLIFT

    inputs: torch.tensor, shape=(n_baselines, 4, length)

    baselines: torch.tensor, shape=(n_baselines, 4, length)

    This function takes in a one-hot encoded sequence (not a string) and
    returns a set of one-hot encoded sequences that are dinucleotide
    shuffled. The approach constructs a transition matrix between
    nucleotides, keeps the first and last nucleotide constant, and then
    randomly at uniform selects transitions until all nucleotides have
    been observed. This is a Eulerian path. Because each nucleotide has
    the same number of transitions into it as out of it (except for the
    first and last nucleotides) the greedy algorithm does not need to
    check at each step to make sure there is still a path.

    This function has been adapted to work on PyTorch tensors instead of
    numpy arrays. Code has been adapted from

    Parameters
    ----------

    random_state: int or None or numpy.random.RandomState, optional
        The random seed to use to ensure determinism. If None, the
        process is not deterministic. Default is None.
